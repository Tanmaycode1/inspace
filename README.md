# Lab Setup and Rocket Launch Prediction Project

Welcome to the Lab Setup and Rocket Launch Prediction Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience for students by partnering with schools and offering industrial training opportunities. Additionally, the project incorporates a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the success of rocket launches and provides visual simulations of these launches.

## Introduction

The Lab Setup and Rocket Launch Prediction Project is a unique initiative aimed at enhancing students' educational experiences. By collaborating with schools, we create a specialized learning environment that combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice. The project also utilizes advanced Machine Learning techniques to predict the outcome of rocket launches and offers interactive simulations to visualize these launches.

## Features

- **Lab Setup:** We establish fully-equipped labs that facilitate practical learning in various scientific and technical domains.
  
- **Rocket Launch Prediction:** Our custom-built ML model analyzes launch data to predict the success of rocket launches, helping to understand critical factors affecting space missions.
  
- **Simulations:** The project provides interactive simulations of rocket launches, offering an immersive experience and aiding in grasping complex aerospace concepts.
  
- **Partnerships:** We collaborate with schools to integrate our lab setup into their curriculum, enriching students' learning journeys.
  
- **Industrial Training:** We offer training programs designed in consultation with industry experts, preparing students for real-world challenges.

## Lab Setup

Our lab setup is designed to provide students with a hands-on learning experience. It includes state-of-the-art equipment, dedicated instructors, and a curated curriculum. The labs cover various fields such as physics, chemistry, electronics, and more. Partnering schools can integrate these labs into their educational programs.

## Rocket Launch Prediction

We've developed an advanced ML model that predicts the success of rocket launches. The model utilizes historical launch data, weather conditions, and technical parameters to make accurate predictions. To use the model, refer to the `rocket_prediction.ipynb` notebook in the `prediction` directory.

## Simulations

The simulation software offers an interactive way to visualize rocket launches. It uses realistic physics simulations to provide an immersive experience. To access the simulations, run the `simulation.py` script located in the `simulations` directory.

## Partnerships

We believe in collaborative learning. Schools interested in partnering with us can reach out via the contact information provided below. We'll work together to integrate the lab setup into your school's curriculum and provide students with a unique learning experience.

## Industrial Training

Our industrial training programs are designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry demands. Students gain practical skills and exposure to real-world scenarios through workshops, internships, and expert-led sessions.
